Rows (sbj)
1,2,3,4,5,8,9,10,11,12,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,30,31,32

Columns
average correlation between each face stimulus and other face stimuli in the following categories
1 - same face
2 - same category
3 - shared irrelevant
4 - diff face (no shared parent)
5 - itemrep d'
6 - itemrep2 d'
7 - cateffect d'
8 - viseffect d'
9 - relcateffect d'
10 - irrelperceffect d'

Measures
itemrep = same face v. diff face (col1 - col4)
itemrep2 = same face v. same category (col1 - col2)
itemrep3 = same face (col1) - mean(same cat (col2) + diff cat (col 4))
cateffect = shared rel (col2) - shared irrelevant (col3)
viseffect = similar v. not similar (mean(col1:3) - mean(col4))
relcateffect = shared rel (col2) - no shared (col4)
irrelperceffect = shared irrelevant (col3) - no shared (col4)
